title: Isabelle Community Contribution Guidelines
---

This repository contains style guidelines for the development of projects with the [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de) proof assistant.

## Introduction
We start with the most important rule: **Every commit** must comply with the standards listed in this document.

This might seem like a lot of work at first, but this is just a short-termed objection. A consistent commitment to these rules means:
1. High quality of theories due to uniform conventions and documentation
2. Easy collaboration due to (1) (searchability, uniformity) and a flexible as well as transparent contribution model
3. Quicker development in the mid-term and long-term due (1) and (2)

Many of the following ideas have been adapted from the very successful, community-driven [mathlib project](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/) for Lean
and its [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib//blob/master/docs/contribute/).
