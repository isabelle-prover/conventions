This website contains style guidelines for the development of projects with the [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de) proof assistant.
Many of these guidelines have been adapted from the successful Lean mathlib
[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/contribute/).
The website is maintained by the [isabelle-prover GitHub group]({{ site.github.owner_url }}),
a self-managed community of Isabelle users.
Feel free to reach out if you are interested in becoming a maintainer or have any questions by creating an [issue on GitHub]({{ site.github.repository_url | append: "/issues/new?labels=community" }}).
