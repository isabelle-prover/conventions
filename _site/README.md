# Isabelle Community Conventions

## What is this?

This repository contains the resources for the [isabelle community conventions](https://isabelle.systems/conventions).
The conventions contain style guidelines for the development of projects with the [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de) proof assistant.
Many of these guidelines have been adapted from the successful Lean mathlib
[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/contribute/).

## How to contribute

If you want to add/udpdate an entry, simply add/edit the corresponding entry in the corresponding directory and create a pull request.
If you need help, simply create an [issue](https://github.com/isabelle-prover/cookbook/issues).
