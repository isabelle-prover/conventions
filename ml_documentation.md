title: ML documentation
---

TODO: this is just a stub.

Undocumented ML-code - or code in general - is virtually incomprehensible.
Here are some guidelines for good code:
- Functions must be short and modular.
- File documentation makes clear how to re-use the development
- Function documentation makes clear what the function is, what the parameters are, and what it does
- Constant documentation makes clear what the constant denotes and its reasonable value ranges.
