title: Isabelle Community Conventions
layout: page
---

This website contains style guidelines for the development of projects with the [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de) proof assistant.
Many of these guidelines have been adapted from the successful Lean mathlib
[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/contribute/).

## Introduction
We start with the most important rule: Every commit/pull request must comply with the standards listed on this website.
This might seem like a lot of work at first,
but experience has shown that a consistent commitment to such rules results in:

1. High quality of theories due to uniform conventions and documentation
2. Easy collaboration due to point 1.;
   in particular, it improves searchability and uniformity of theories and offers a flexible as well as transparent contribution model
3. Quicker development in the mid-term and long-term due points 1. and 2.
