# Isabelle Community Contribution Guidelines

We start with the most important rule: **Every commit** must comply with the standards listed in this document.

This might seem like a lot of work at first, but this is just a short-termed objection. A consistent commitment to these rules means:
1. high quality of theories due to uniform conventions and documentation
2. easy collaboration due to 1. (searchability, uniformity) and a flexible as well as transparent contribution model
3. quicker development in the mid-term and long-term due 1. and 2.

Many of the following ideas have been adapted from the very successful, community-driven [mathlib project](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/) for Lean
with its [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib//blob/master/docs/contribute/).
