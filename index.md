# Isabelle Community Contribution Guidelines

We start with the most important rule: Every commit/pull request must comply with the standards listed in this document.

This might seem like a lot of work at first, but experience has shown that a consistent commitment to such rules means:
1. high quality of theories due to uniform conventions and documentation
2. easy collaboration due to 1. (searchability, uniformity) and a flexible as well as transparent contribution model
3. quicker development in the mid-term and long-term due 1. and 2.
